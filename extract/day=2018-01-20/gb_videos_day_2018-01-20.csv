The script is over 150 pages so I’m only going over things that  are not included in the movie and there Aare lots of them which is why the video is pretty long but it’s totally worth it since we finally get answers for basically everything. All engineer dialogs and writings in the script are translated so we are getting a clear understanding things without over theorizing.\n\nThe script is written by Damon Lindelof and the awakened engineer is referred in conversations as the Last Engineer.  \n\nTHE ELDER Take this. This is the blood of our lord. For we cannot create as the gift was stripped from us long ago. As always we will continue our attempts to create a perfect Eden much like our own. You, the chosen one will create it in your own image.\nLet your body become the dirt. Your blood become the waters. And may your soul become their way back to us\n\nThere are lots of interesting details that are brought up in this dialog. First we learn that the substance in the sealed cup is the blood of their lord which really intrigued me when I first read it. I wouldn’t say the substance is completely gold in the movie, however it certainly has some golden shades. But most importantly we get a confirmation that it’s not the black go.  Another thing is that the elder was thousands of years old. All of these new elements are addressed later in the script so we will get back to them. \n\nDAVID reads in engineer language Only the chosen can pass through. This is sacred ground and must be kept sacred. If you dare to cross into sacred ground you must be punished. This is the birth place of our lord and no being is worthy \n \nHolloway arrives around the BACK of the monument and shines his light up at another MURAL which has been embedded on the wall. A strange BEING unlike any ENGINEER is drawn on the MURAL. It has it's arms out in a cross. Around the MURAL it shows an IMAGE of an engineer being ATTACKED and impregnated by some NASTY looking OCTOPUS type CREATURE. The being with it's arms stretched out is a bipedal POINTY-HEADED creature - the first “DEACON”.\n\n DAVID (Engineer language) Our lord came from the chosen one in the time when our ancestors birthed life. His sacred blood was our salvation. His sacred blood through our lips birthed life on other worlds. \n DAVID I am not entirely certain, but I believe the humanoid seen being attacked orally gave birth to this being and your Engineers worshiped it. I believe what is ever inside these capsules might be some kind of experiment. If my translation is correct then they were trying to recreate the blood of this being whom they worshiped.\nRecall that the elder engineer said in the beginning:   \nwe cannot create as the gift was stripped from us long ago. As always we will continue our attempts to create a perfect Eden much like our own.\nDespite the fact that engineers could live for thousands of years, they were slowly dying off and their only way to prevent extinction was to seed with life other planets using the blood of the first deacon. \nThey were traveling through space seeding planets with life in an attempt to recreate their homewolrd, but the blood of the first deacon was running out.\nIt appears that these beings can live up to three hundred thousand years old. They use to be able to mate with each other just like humans. But somewhere in their late history they evolved and lost the ability to both mate and reproduce. But before they did they found a creature that impregnated one of them with a foreign body. A creature came from him. They called it the Deacon. They worshiped this deacon and after it's death they used its blood to plant the seeds of life on other worlds. The blood ran out of course but they tried to recreate the gene pool of this Deacon's blood but they instead created something else. That is what I brought back with me, sir.\n\nMuch later in the script when Weyland, David, shaw and some other crew members approach the sleeping engineer, David explains that dispite the fact the black goo was the failed attempt of clonning the blood of the first deacon, engineers realized it’s potential for weapons.\n\nHate? We gave you this emotion. We gave you all emotion We had expected not of your evolution. We gave you Eden.We came back and saved your souls but we left you to make your own fate. But your kind is a barbaric violent species. We tried once more to save you."

The lead singer with the Irish band The Cranberries, was in London for a short recording session, her rep said in a statement to multiple media outlets, adding that no further details were available.\n\nO’Riordan rose to fame as the gentle voice behind some of The Cranberries’ biggest hits, including “Zombie” and “Linger,” the latter of which, a lilting love song, served as the band’s breakthrough hit in 1993.

Roller Coaster \n블랙아이드필승이 결성 이래 처음으로 프로듀싱 한 여성 솔로 곡이다. 컨템포러리 R&B 장르의 황금기인 90년대 특유의 바이브와 현대적으로 재해석된 투스텝 리듬을 조화롭게 재단하여 청하를 위한 새로운 트랙이 만들어졌다. 누군가와 사랑에 빠졌을 때 너무나 달콤하지만 가끔은 아찔하고 위험한 기분을 느끼는 현재 상황을 롤러코스터에 비유하여 표현하였다. 이 곡은 데모에서부터 앨범을 위해 마스터로 프레싱 되기까지 총 6개월이란 시간이 걸렸는데 그만큼 곡 안에서 표현되는 감정, 가사, 멜로디, 편곡 등 이 모든 것들이 세세하게 다듬어지고 재배치되어 완벽하게 완성되었다. 청량하게 울려 퍼지는 인트로에서부터 마지막 청하의 매력적인 애드리브 섹션까지 놓칠 수 없는 짜릿한 곡이다.\n\n\nCJ E&M Music은 아시아 No.1 엔터테인먼트 기업인 CJ E&M의 음악사업 브랜드로 음원/음반의 투자/제작/유통부터 콘서트/페스티벌 개최까지 포함하고 있습니다.

And thank you, for everything else. The opportunities, the love and support, the friendship. All of this that exists is beautiful, and I cherish it endlessly. I am sending you loads of happy thoughts. Make the rest of your day amazing, to the best of your ability!\n       This past month saw so many things! For one, it was finals week. This year, things were a little different for my department. We don’t get a huge final assignment, but instead our final is a compiled evaluation of everything we did in our studios this last term. (2 classes out of 5) \n        I was so lucky to get to go skiing twice in the span of a month- for the 2nd and 3rd time ever!! I am slowly getting the hang of it…… ha...I didn’t do so bad, considering that it was early winter, and the conditions were reaally really bad. So icy, it was more like hail balls. There wasn’t so much footage during those small trips, because I took the time to enjoy everything without rushing to capture it through the lens. It was nice to unwind and relax.\nAfter going back to new york, spending a couple days there ended with flying home. Our house was very different without my grandparents. Especially contrasting it to my christmas vlog last year, there is no running away from life’s truth that things will change, and there is no stopping it. My grandpa is in his last days, and my grandma insists on being by his side in the care home everyday. I would visit a few times, although he rarely gains consciousness anymore. My heart and prayers go out to him. Thank you for all of your prayers, too. Truly.\n          Despite everything, I’m glad my sister and I still pulled together a little dinner! We last minute thought, “why not”, the morning of. The spirit was just absent this year. And sometimes, it’s hard being the only one who cares. If it weren’t for my sister, this wouldn’t have happened! That’s why I’m thankful that we still made the best of it. \nI had a year filled with so many new experiences, lessons, and ups & downs, and the vlog ends with us entering the new year. Thank you for being on this journey with me, I love you.\nYours truly,\nAnnabelle\n____________\nIN THIS VIDEO:\n00:27 *yellow sweater- SHEIN http://bit.ly/2h6bWmq\n Grey hoodie- HANES\n01:17 black sweater- stole from dad\n Jeans- THRIFTED\n Boots- DOC MARTINS\n01:27 bath bomb- LUSH https://goo.gl/yRJLcf\n02:12 coat- TOPSHOP\nRest of ski clothes- SAVERS/rentals\n03:55 dress- THRIFTED in LA\n Xmas tree- TARGET\n04:03 head bands- DOLLAR TREE\n05:12 white longsleeve- UNIQLO https://goo.gl/AAUS5X\n05:46 apron- MINISO\n06:55 grey crewneck- one that I designed back in highschool.\n07:50 jeans- THRIFTED\n Pink hoodie- (I got it at a craft's store but you can buy here with a bunch more color options https://goo.gl/XPH0W5)\n08:20 scarf- ALDO ACCESSORIES\n Coat- ZARA\n11:24 *yellow sweater- SHEIN http://bit.ly/2gWwgDh\n *hoop earrings- SHEIN http://bit.ly/2tghElU\n11:45 single bulbs- AMAZON https://goo.gl/Y7LZQw\n *yellow sweater- SHEIN http://bit.ly/2imMvd4 \n12:14 ski helmet- AMAZON https://goo.gl/MF31Gg\n14:07 clothing rack- AMAZON https://goo.gl/hy6i3H\n16:55 blue sweater- FOREVER21\n Laundry basket- DAISO\n17:33 brown sweater- mom’s, think she bought it from taobao\n Pj pants- TARGET\n Xmas tree- $5 tree from CVS we bought TEN YEARS AGO HAHA\n19:16 the kitchen timer of my dreams- ANTHROPOLOGIE  (kikkerland) https://goo.gl/rMKM9y\n20:17 scarf- ALDO\n jacket - BERSHKA\n21:58 grey fleece jacket- stole from dad\n_____________\nDISCOUNTS + PROMO CODES FOR YOU 💞\n$10 OFF AMAZON PRIME\nhttp://a.co/1q3PK8j\nAIRBNB:\nhttp://www.airbnb.com/c/annabelleg169 for $40 AIRBNB travel \nCredit!\nGRUBHUB (FOOD!!)\nhttps://refer.grubhub.com/s/nunnp for $7 off your order\nEYEBUYDIRECT:\n IFE2MWGNTM  for $10 discount on eyebuydirect.com\ninstagram: http://instagram.com/pyperbleu\nCats’ instagram: http://instagram.com/catcreatures\ntwitter: https://twitter.com/pyperbleu      \n__\nVIDEO:\n-Final Cut Pro x edited by Annabelle G\n-Canon PowershotG7x + iphone 7\n \nMUSIC: songs from epidemicsound.com \nFTC DISCLAIMER: Not a sponsored video.

12997,_7985zBEM3o,2018-01-20,Primitive Technology: A-frame hut,Primitive Technology,22,2018-01-19 21:09:10+00:00,[none],1471975,95001,597,9097,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/_7985zBEM3o/default.jpg,False,False,False,"I built an A frame hut as a large work space for projects. First I made a celt hatchet to cut timber for the hut. The axe head was made of amphibolite and the handle was made of a species of wattle. For the hut the floor plan was 4 X 4m. The height of the ridgeline was 2 m above the ground. +A post was planted in the ground to support the ridge pole at the back of the structure and an A frame was put in the front to support the ridgeline. The rafters of the hut were then attached to the ridgepole. Palm fronds were then collected, split and lashed to this frame. The dome hut was disassembled and its thatch was added to the structure. Approximately 1200 fronds were used in total. For the ridgeline, thatch was lifted in place and rested on without lashing it down. Instead, pairs of sticks lashed together were lifted in place sitting over thatch preventing it from blowing away. These are known as “jockeys” as they resemble a rider sitting on a horse.\nA wall of wattle and daub was built at the back of the structure. Wooden poles were planted into the ground and lawyer cane was woven between them. Soil was dug from around the hut forming drainage trenches while also supplying the mud used to daub the wall. No fibre was added to the daub, just straight mud. Pegs were stuck into the wall to form a convenient rack to hold the stone axe off the ground when not in use. Later, pegs were added to support the fire sticks too. A bed was made by hammering in wooden stakes and lashing timber to the frame. This was covered with palm fibre to act as bedding. Atherton oak nuts were then collected and eaten/stored in a pot. Latter, heavy rain fell testing the huts ability to shed rain. The hut stayed dry while the water flowed off the thatch and into the drainage trenches left over from digging the mud for the wall.\nThe A frame hut is a simple shelter that can be built quickly and simply. It’s basically a large roof built directly on the ground. The shape is strong and should resist strong winds. This hut is the biggest one I’ve built on this channel and could fit both the tiled roof hut and wattle and daub hut inside it with room left over along the sides. It requires no scaffolding or ladders to build. A person can walk right down the centre without ducking while the sides that are too low to stand in are used for storing firewood, tools and other things. A fire lit in the entrance will greatly reduce the number of mosquitoes in the hut though it will get smokey occasionally. To reduce smoke, a small stove could be built to burn the wood more efficiently. A chimney and fireplace could be built also, but would take more time.\nWordpress: https://primitivetechnology.wordpress.com\nPatreon page: https://www.patreon.com/user?u=2945881\nI have no face book page, instagram, twitter etc. Beware of fake pages."

Red Nose Day is a reputable charity that helps children in poverty--the exact demographic that I've worked with. These children are primarily in the United States. They serve meals, provide essential medical services, help educate and house those who need it. \n\nWhy the phrase “Gucci Gang”?\nGucci Gang is an extremely relevant and popular song/phrase at the moment. It (was) fun to say and is catchy.\n\nDo you have a life?\nNo.\n\nWhy did you do this?\nI’ve done these kinds of streams before, but I wanted to attempt something a little more ambitious. \n\nAll revenue generated by advertisements on this video will be donated monthly to https://rednoseday.org/"

Michail, Will Arnett and Peggy Regan are producing, with Sam Register, Jelenic, and Horvath serving as executive producers.  Apart from Arnett, all are “Teen Titans GO!” series contributors.\n\nSet to release on July 27, 2018, “Teen Titans GO! to the Movies” will be distributed worldwide by Warner Bros. Pictures, a Warner Bros. Entertainment Company."
