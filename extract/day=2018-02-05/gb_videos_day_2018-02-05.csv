With the Y Fliker, there’s no more kicking the pavement like traditional two wheel scooters. Riders simply move their hips from side to side to get going, while continuing to use their own body power for self-propelling fun. The Y Fliker’s patented technology, light-weight and sleek design, combined with performance rated wheels, allows this free-style scooter to perform smooth carving and drifting action.  And the quick response hand brake offers kids increased control and ensures a safe, fun ride!

We remember it as a golden time of good, healthy, outdoor fun. Without a handset in sight. So, with our love of toys like go-karts that put smiles on kiddies’ faces and wind in their hair, we all ended up in the outdoor toys industry.\n\nWe imported toys and it was all going rather well. But, deep down, we had this crazy desire to develop our own. We wanted to control our own destiny and launch products our way. \n\nIn 2009, we were reborn with even more wind in our hair and a new dream of working with a design company to sell their new ‘balance’ bikes around the world. We started co-designing some nice products with them and feeding back on other product ideas.\n\nAt last, we had our little fingers firmly wrapped around the handlebars of the industry and, in 2011, we launched in over 40 countries and spanning the Globe from the US to Korea. In 2012, we came out with a shiny new brand and went global. Pull up a chair, put the kettle on and see how we get on. \n\nYvolution – Life Through Motion – Scooter that grow with your child and develop their motor, balance and co-ordination skills.\n\nConnect with us:\n\nYoutube Channel - http://bit.ly/yvolutionYoutube \nFacebook - http://bit.ly/YvolutionFB \nInstagram - http://bit.ly/YvolutionInstagram \nTwitter - http://bit.ly/YvolutionTwitter \n\nLeave us a comment below!"

Insert the final trailer after it's uploaded this Sunday or Monday (You'll see the spot for it) This way we can have the reaction video out before everyone else. Our reactions will probably match up to the trailer as these SW trailers are pretty boilerplate and predictable at this point. Remember DO NOT POST THIS anytime before the official release of the trailer. We'll look really stupid. Also, Rich - a collection agency keeps calling my phone looking for you. They sounded pretty mad. Made some comments about breaking your legs - which seemed a little unusual for collections? Your gambling habit hasn't resurfaced again has it? If so we need to have a talk. DO NOT borrow money from Jimmy the leg breaker Malone anymore. Okay, talk with you guys soon. - Mike"

But when an even more unstoppable threat is unleashed to tear through our cities and bring the world to its knees, he is given one last chance to live up to his father’s legacy by his estranged sister, Mako Mori (Rinko Kikuchi)—who is leading a brave new generation of pilots that have grown up in the shadow of war. As they seek justice for the fallen, their only hope is to unite together in a global uprising against the forces of extinction. \n\nJake is joined by gifted rival pilot Lambert (The Fate of the Furious’ Scott Eastwood) and 15-year-old Jaeger hacker Amara (newcomer Cailee Spaeny), as the heroes of the PPDC become the only family he has left. Rising up to become the most powerful defense force to ever walk the earth, they will set course for a spectacular all-new adventure on a towering scale. \n\nPacific Rim Uprising is directed by Steven S. DeKnight (Netflix’s Daredevil, STARZ’s Spartacus) and also stars Jing Tian, Burn Gorman, Adria Arjona and Charlie Day. \n\n#JoinTheUprising #PacificRimUprising"

But the people have found salvation in the OASIS, an expansive virtual reality universe created by the brilliant and eccentric James Halliday (Mark Rylance).  When Halliday dies, he leaves his immense fortune to the first person to find a digital Easter egg he has hidden somewhere in the OASIS, sparking a contest that grips the entire world.  When an unlikely young hero named Wade Watts (Tye Sheridan) decides to join the contest, he is hurled into a breakneck, reality-bending treasure hunt through a fantastical universe of mystery, discovery and danger.\n\nSpielberg directed the film from a screenplay by Zak Penn and Ernest Cline.  The film was produced by Donald De Line, Spielberg, Kristie Macosko Krieger and Dan Farah; with Adam Somner, Daniel Lupi, Chris deFaria and Bruce Berman serving as executive producers.  \n\n“Ready Player One” stars Tye Sheridan (“X-Men: Apocalypse,” “Mud”), Olivia Cooke (“Me and Earl and the Dying Girl,” “Bates Motel”), Ben Mendelsohn (“Rogue One – A Star Wars Story,” “Bloodline”) and T.J. Miller (“Deadpool,” “Silicon Valley”), with Simon Pegg (the “Star Trek” movies, the “Mission: Impossible” movies) and Oscar winner Mark Rylance (“Bridge of Spies,” “Dunkirk”).  \n\nBehind the scenes, three-time Oscar winner Spielberg (“Schindler’s List,” “Saving Private Ryan”) reunited his creative team from “Bridge of Spies,” including Oscar-winning director of photography Janusz Kaminski (“Schindler’s List,” “Saving Private Ryan”), Oscar-winning production designer Adam Stockhausen (“The Grand Budapest Hotel”), Oscar-winning editor Michael Kahn (“Saving Private Ryan,” “Raiders of the Lost Ark”) and Sarah Broshar (“The Post”), and costume designer Kasia Walicka-Maimone (“Moonrise Kingdom”).  The music is by Oscar-nominated composer Alan Silvestri (the “Back to the Future” films, “Forrest Gump”).\n\nWarner Bros. Pictures and Amblin Entertainment present, in association with Village Roadshow Pictures, an Amblin Production, a De Line Pictures Production, a Steven Spielberg Film, “Ready Player One.”\n\nSlated for release on March 30, 2018, the film will be distributed by Warner Bros. Pictures, a Warner Bros. Entertainment Company, and in select territories by Village Roadshow Pictures."

Isla Nublar now sits abandoned by humans while the surviving dinosaurs fend for themselves in the jungles. \n\nWhen the island’s dormant volcano begins roaring to life, Owen (Chris Pratt) and Claire (Bryce Dallas Howard) mount a campaign to rescue the remaining dinosaurs from this extinction-level event. Owen is driven to find Blue, his lead raptor who’s still missing in the wild, and Claire has grown a respect for these creatures she now makes her mission. Arriving on the unstable island as lava begins raining down, their expedition uncovers a conspiracy that could return our entire planet to a perilous order not seen since prehistoric times.\n\nWith all of the wonder, adventure and thrills synonymous with one of the most popular and successful series in cinema history, this all-new motion-picture event sees the return of favorite characters and dinosaurs—along with new breeds more awe-inspiring and terrifying than ever before. Welcome to Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom. \n\nStars Pratt and Howard return alongside executive producers Steven Spielberg and Colin Trevorrow for Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom. They are joined by co-stars James Cromwell, Ted Levine, Justice Smith, Geraldine Chaplin, Daniella Pineda, Toby Jones, Rafe Spall and Isabella Sermon, while BD Wong and Jeff Goldblum reprise their roles. \n\nDirected by J.A. Bayona (The Impossible), the epic action-adventure is written by Jurassic World’s director, Trevorrow, and its co-writer, Derek Connolly. Producers Frank Marshall and Pat Crowley once again partner with Spielberg and Trevorrow in leading the filmmakers for this stunning installment. Belén Atienza joins the team as a producer."

Joe Kennedy (D-MA) sharply criticized President Donald Trump and his administration, giving the Democratic party's response to the State of the Union with a speech that became a rallying cry around key causes that make up his party's coalition.\nKennedy, who spoke in front of a Mustang on a car lift in the autoshop at Diman Regional Technical School in Fall River, Massachusetts, pitched the Democratic Party as a party that helps Coal miners or single moms. Rural communities or inner cities. The coast or the heartland.\nSo here is the answer Democrats offer tonight: we choose both, he said. We fight for both. Because the strongest, richest, greatest nation in the world shouldn't leave any one behind.\nKennedy, who comes from one of the most prominent families in American politics, referenced helping immigrants, addressing those affected by the expiring Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program and at one point speaking to them in Spanish. \nHe indirectly referenced Trump as a bully during his response.\nBullies may land a punch. They might leave a mark, the Massachusetts Democrat said. But they have never, not once, in the history of our United States, managed to match the strength and spirit of a people united in defense of their future.\nHe also tied the turmoil of the past year to Trump's administration, saying, We all feel the fault lines of a fractured country ... We hear the voices of Americans who feel forgotten and forsaken.\nKennedy slammed Trump for targeting laws that protect Americans."
